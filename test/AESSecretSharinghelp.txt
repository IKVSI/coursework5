USE: AESSecretSharing.exe decrypt(d) [K] [key file] [output file]

K           -   number of shares to restore information
S           -   number of AES encrypted shares
N           -   number of all shares
S >= 2 and N > K to avoid 1 fail; N < S + K because you must use 1 S-share; S < K => K >= 3 to share secret
key file    -   path to file; use first 32 byte of file for encryption key
input file  -   path to file for ecnrypt
output file -   path to files for decrypt
File encrypt in shares named:
	 "input file.enc" - encrypted shares
	 "input file.shr" - open shares
So if you want to restore file, you must have k-shares named filename(.enc/.shr).
